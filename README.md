# To-do:
```Fix title breaking when you spam press the button
~~Add a button for copying the changed code out (maybe)~~ decided against this
Special effect for cherry.

Plum - ~~encode all string literals as base64~~ special effect for plum

Orange - add random functions that do a ton of 'complex' stuff but just pass / return 0 / have no implementations

Bell - add random docstrings / comments?
(seems complicated. imagine implementing an LLM to write comments in the code lmao)
(might just limit it to a list of comments that are broad enough that they'll suit anything)

Bar - jackpot (do all of the other ones, unless i can think of smth better)

Lemon - add classes with massive \_\_init\_\_ functions that do nothing```
