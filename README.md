# To-do:
```Fix title breaking when you spam press the button
Add a button for copying the changed code out (maybe)
Special effect for cherry.

Plum - encode all string literals as base64

Orange - add random functions that do a ton of 'complex' stuff but just pass / return 0 / have no implementations

Bell - add random docstrings / comments? (seems complicated. imagine implementing an LLM to write comments in the code lmao)

Bar - jackpot maybe, might do all of them if i cant think of anything better

Lemon - add classes with massive \_\_init\_\_ functions that do nothing```
