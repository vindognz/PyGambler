# To-do:
Fix title breaking when you spam press the button

**Special effects for:**
`Cherry, Plum, Orange, Bell, Bar`

Orange - add random functions that do a ton of 'complex' stuff but just pass / return 0 / have no implementations

Bell - add random docstrings / comments?
(might just limit it to a list of comments that are broad enough that they'll suit anything)

Bar - jackpot (just call every other effect, maybe a cool animation)
